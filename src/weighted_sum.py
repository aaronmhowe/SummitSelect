This class implements the weight sum machine learning model, which is used
to merge the three sorted lists for number of runs, lift ticket pricing, and
peak elevation data, created based on users' selected preferences. This model is
responsible for constructing a list that ranks a resort for a criteria that could be
"Most number of runs, don't care about pricing, with highest quality of snow", or 
"Don't care about number of runs, cheapest resorts, highest quality of snow".
